		<p>Atticus said to Jem <sup>one</sup> <sub>day</sub> <br> <b>"I'd rather you shot at a tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the
		blue jays you you want, if you can hit 'em, <u>but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.</u>"</b> That was
		the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and i asked Miss Maudie about it.
		<b>"Your father's right," she said. "Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to
		enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but
		sing their hearts out of us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."</b></p>
